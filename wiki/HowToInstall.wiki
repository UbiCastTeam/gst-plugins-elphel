Tested on Ubuntu 8.10

To compile, additionally to the basic development tools (from build-essential, automake, autoconf, libtool), you will need (from apt on Ubuntu/Debian systems):
  * libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev
  * libgstreamer0.10-dev

= Get the source =

svn checkout http://gst-plugins-elphel.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gst-plugins-elphel

= Compilation =
== jp462bayer ==

From your gst-plugins-elphel directory:
  * cd jp462bayer
  * ./autogen.sh
  * make
  * cp src/.libs/libgstjp462bayer.so ~/.gstreamer-0.10/plugins$

== bayer2rgb2 == 

From your gst-plugins-elphel directory:
  * cd bayer2rgb2
  * ./autogen.sh
  * make
  * cp /src/.libs/libgstbayer2rgb2.so ~/.gstreamer-0.10/plugins$

= Checking =

Now you can use gst-inspect to verify the plugins have been built and installed successfully:

  * gst-inspect bayer2rgb2
  * gst-inspect jp462bayer
